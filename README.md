# Deploy-a-high-availability-web-app-using-CloudFormation
Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. We have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.

There will be two parts to this project:

Diagram: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
Script (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.
